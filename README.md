# Python-Web-Basics
In the "Python Web Basics" course, we laid the foundations of Web programming with Python and Django. We looked at how networks actually work, what HTTP is, and what the basic principles of web development are. We learned to work with databases and write basic SQL queries. In the course we worked with the basic concepts in the MTV (Model-Template-View) architecture. The training included hands-on labs and workshops for building complete, full-featured Django web applications. <br>
